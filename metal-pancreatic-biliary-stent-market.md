<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Pancreatic & Biliary Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Metal Stent</li><li>Uncovered Metal Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Metal Pancreatic & Biliary Stent Market features two main types: Covered Metal Stents and Uncovered Metal Stents. Covered Metal Stents are designed with a polymer layer that prevents tissue ingrowth, making them suitable for longer-term applications. In contrast, Uncovered Metal Stents lack this coating, allowing for tissue integration, which is beneficial for certain conditions but may lead to blockage over time. Both types serve critical roles in managing bile duct and pancreatic obstructions, offering distinct advantages based on patient needs.</p></p>
