<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Lithotripter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intracorporeal Lithotripter</li><li>Extracorporeal Lithotripter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ultrasonic lithotripter market comprises two main types: intracorporeal and extracorporeal lithotripters. Intracorporeal lithotripters operate within the body, using ultrasound energy to fragment stones during minimally invasive procedures, leading to reduced recovery times. In contrast, extracorporeal lithotripters generate high-energy shockwaves outside the body to disintegrate stones, commonly used for kidney and urinary stones. Both types play a crucial role in urology, enhancing stone treatment efficiency and patient outcomes while minimizing invasiveness.</p></p>
